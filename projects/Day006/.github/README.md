# Day 006 project - Escaping the Maze

This program consist of a very simple algorithm to help a robot to cross the finish line in a maze. The robot is randomly generated in the maze. The strategy is to keep a wall on the right while going through the maze.

You can try the challenge at [Reeborg's World - Maze wold](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json).

If you want to check my solution, you can copy the code at [escaping-the-maze.py](../escaping-the-maze.py) file, and paste it on Reeborg's World web.
