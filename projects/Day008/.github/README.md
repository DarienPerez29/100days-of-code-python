# Day 008 project - Caesar cipher

This is a program to encrypt and decrypt messages using Caesar cipher. You can select if you want to *encrypt* or *decrypt* a message, then you enter your message and the shift that you want. Finally the program prints your encrypted or decrypted message and ask if you want to run the program again.
