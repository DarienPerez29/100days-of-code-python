# Day 016 project - Coffee Machine (OOP)

This program simulates a coffee machine via terminal. It's like the previous project, but implementing OOP.

### Functions of the "Coffee Machine"
1. Asks what type of coffee do you like (espresso/latte/cappuccino).
2. Checks if resources are sufficient for making the selected coffee.
3. If there are enough resources, the machine should asks the user to insert coins.
    - If the user doesn't insert enough coins for their coffee, the machine returns the money.
    - If the user inserts the exact amount of coins, the machine delivers the user's coffee.
    - If the user inserts too many coins, the machine delivers the user's coffee and returns the exchange.
4. It updates resources (water, milk, coffee, and money) when coffee is made.

#### Secret words
1. **off**: turns off the machine.
2. **report**: prints the resources of the machine.
