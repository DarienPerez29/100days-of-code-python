# Day 003 project - Treasure Island Game

This is a little terminal game in which you have to make decisions to get the treasure. If you take the wrong decisions, you might die (game over). Just luck and replay are required to win, no logic whatsoever is needed. Try it [here](https://replit.com/@DarienPerez29/treasure-map-game?embed=1&output=1).
