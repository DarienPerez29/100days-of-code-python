# Day 014 project - Higher or lower

This is a project based on [The Higher Lower Game](https://higherlowergame.com), but a little bit simpler and via terminal. This game consists in show two options, A and B, and you need to guess if B option has more or less followers on Instagram (higher or lower) than option A. If you get it right, you sum points to your score, if you get it wrong, you lose and your final score is shown.
