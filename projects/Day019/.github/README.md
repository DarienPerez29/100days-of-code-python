# Day 19 project - Etch a Sketch & Turtle Racing

This day consist in two projects:
1. [Etch A Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch), which is a tool that allows us to draw using two knobs. This project consist in making something similar using the Turtle library, controlling the turtle with our arrow keys.
2. **Turtle Racing**, a gambling "game" *(do **NOT** gamble in real life, please)*, where you choose a horse, then the game start, and the horses race each other going forward randomly. You win if your horse wins the race. It's like [Sigma Derby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_Derby).
