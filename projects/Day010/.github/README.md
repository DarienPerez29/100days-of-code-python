# Day 010 project - Calculator

This is a calculator that first asks for a number, then lets you choose an operation *(addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division)*, and then asks for another number. Displays the full operation and the result, and then asks you if you want to start a new operation or if you want to make a new operation with the previous value calculated.
