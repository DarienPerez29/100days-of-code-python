# 100 Days of code - Python

This is a challenge/course of [100 days of code in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/). In my opinion, this is a very nice challenge to improve Python skills and to make a great portfolio for future job oportunities. I wanted to start this challenge because now (1/09/2022) I'm finally free of school, which gives me a lot of time to boost my knowledge about software development.

I'll share my projects and programs in this repo, so I can use them as evidence to get a nice job in the future. Probably the most elaborated/complex projects of this challenge will get their own repo, but I will also include them in this repo so I can have everything in order.
